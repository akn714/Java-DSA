```java

Student s1 = new Student();
                    ^
                // this is constructor

```
* constructors do not return anaything
* just like constructors, there are distructors also
* in java concept of distructor is default because java can collect garbage automatically


***Polymorphism***
* function overloading - compile time polymorphism
* fuction overriding - run time polymorphism
